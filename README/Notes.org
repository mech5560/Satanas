*Things i am doing per day * 


* 04/06 
  
** New Version PC
** 09:23 Implementation of the predictor-corrector scheme

*** Notes
- I need to create another another function for the intermediate velocities of the
  corrector step.

- In addition, I need to update a few variables in order to compute correctly
  the intermediate velocity at the corrector step
**** Variables that i will switch in order to compute the residuals correctly are. 
- All the rhos
- the residuals




*** Intermediate velocity function (Corrector)
- I will use the projection - implicit  method which means that the functions
  that will be modified are the int_vel_pro_imp

*** Outcome
- I was able to increase the time step from (0.05*0.05) to *(0.6*0.05)



** 13:51 Comparison of the implicit and the explicit treatment

*** Notes
- I am doing that to check if the implementation of the implicit treatment has
  dicreased the size of the boundary layer that was shown at the streamwise
  component of the velocity.
-  This is expected because i am introducing extra boundary conditions for the 
u_tilda over the vertical direction
- Also, I need to check if the pressure gradient must be multiplied by 2 or 3 at
  the boundaries.


*** Outcome
- As expected the explicit method produces a bigger boundary layer than the
  implicit implementation.

- there is not a big difference between the 2 and 3 for the pressure gradient


** Turbulent Channel Flow

** 17:14 First of all i ll try to made my code more readable. 
- One way to do that is to put all the ghost cell dimensions inside a struct
  in order to be able to implement the boundary conditions inside functions easier.


* 11/06

** Post-Processing [4/4]

- [X] Write a C program that converts binary data into Ascii[3/3]
  - [X] Converts grid info
  - [X] Convert scalar data from a plane
  - [X] Convert scalar data from  the whole domain

- [X] Write a C program that computes vorticities[0/0]
  - This program will receive as inputs the three components of the velocity
  - Also it will take as an input the domain information.
  - **** Since i ll use fourth order accurate schemes i need to introduce also
    the ghost cells ****
- [X] Means and fluctuations


- [X] Write a C program that creates the planar data that are necessary for
  non-uniform grid 


* 19/06 

** Writing the function that computes the filtered subgrid stress tensor
- One good idea for parallelizing my code is to store the coefficients into an
  external file and use them inside my inline functions

* 23/06
- I ll introduce the eddy viscosity that i ve computed on Friday to my code
  - The eddy viscosity is computed in the main
  - then is passed to the tilda functions, the residual and the viscous
    components
  - Finally the eddy viscosity is used inside the viscous components
