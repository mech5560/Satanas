***** Things i am doing per day


**** 27/06

*** General changes in the code
-  I introduced the density in the computation of the rhs of the poisson
  equation

*** Modifications on the code
** 17:00
- I created, allocated memory etc, the necessary matrices in order to apply
  the correction in u_tilda correctly

- I need to modify the operations that are executed with the new vectors.

*** Modifications on the code

** 09:14
- Yesterday I introduced the P^{n-1} and the potential function.
- Today I will fill these matrices and perform the correction that christos
  suggested correctly.
- After that, I ll create a version of the code that computes the viscous
  fluxes, in one direction, implicitly
* Outcome
- The boundary layer that was introduced is smaller now and the problem is
  smoother now.


** 11:15
- I ll modify the code in order to compute the viscous fluxes in the
  y-direction(wall BC) implicitly.
* Notes regarding the implementation of the implicit fluxes [1/1]
- [X] Read the bamdad's code to get an indication on the methidollogy I ll use
- In each equation I ll compute the tilda's implicitly for the d/dy(d/dy)
 component.
- So, in the X-direction, matrix A will be d/dy(du_tilda/dy)
  -   In the Y-direction, matrix A will be d/dy(dv_tilda/dy)
  -   in the Z-direction, matrix A will be d/dy(dw_tilda/dz)
