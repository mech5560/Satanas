Intermediate_Velocity_X_Corrector.cpp -- This function computes
the velocity_x_tilda implicitly over the y-direction. More
specifically, it solves  d/dy(du/dy) = rhs, where rhs is given from
eq.30 of the Lessani-Papalexandris paper. Of course, the d/dy(du/dy)
term of the Residual at time n is treated differently depending on
the implicit schemes that is used

It must be stressed that the Projection is refering to the projection
method that is used to correct the velocity_z_tilda. Specifically the
Bell et. al method is used.

Also, since this function is applied at the corrector stage, a slight
modification is being done on the calculation on the residuals for the
RHS. 
The differences between  the two versions are, 
- velocity_x_old is introduced and is used on the computation of the
rhs.
- the rhs is computed with the trapezoidal rule instead of the Addam's
Basworth scheme
