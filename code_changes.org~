* In this file i am saving the changes- potential bugs- that i ve made in my code

- I found an error in the computation of the viscus_xx and viscous_zz

- I added the eddy viscosity on the computation of the coefficients for
  the tridiagonal system

- I am computing the dt based on the smallest dx_i and the gretest u_i,
  not based on the dx_i/u_i.


- I am deleting the potential from my code. i can find it in the main_projection code



- I will just use the pressure gradient only at the boundaries of the tildas

  
** 06/08
- I am switching the directions of the code from x to z.
  - to do that a putted the pressure gradient in the z direction
  - i changed the initialization of the velocities
  - i am changing the geometry of the problem
